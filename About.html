    The purpose of this blog is to account the journey of my trials and tribulations through the hostile landscape of a school known as Dev Bootcamp. It is 19 weeks of coding challenges, development techniques, group projects, and soft skills. I'm probably leaving a lot out but if you're interested I suggest you look and the <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learn-ruby-javascript/overview/">website</a>. Also these blogs were really helpful to me: <a href="https://dukegreene.wordpress.com/2014/04/14/follow-up-the-scoop-on-dev-bootcamp/">Duke Greene</a> and <a href="http://jayrob.in/dev-bootcamp-phase-1-week-2-day-6/">jayrobin</a>.

  <h1>Why am I coding?</h1>
  <p>
    The short answer, curiousity.
    </br>
    The magic that goes on behind the internet has long intrigued me. Often times I find myself asking seemingly annoying questions to people. How do I remote login to my computer through my phone? How does AJAX make the internet fast? How does.. Until one day, a friend of mine (who happens to be a programmer), asked me if I had ever tried to code in javascript before. I went to barnes and nobles the next day and bought 'Javascript: The Definitve Guide'. It feels weird to say this but I fell in love. I put my head down in that book and when I looked up I had been coding and reading for twelve hours. The only thing left to do is follow this path to it's logical conclusion.

    Brian Eno slides whispers tunes through my headphones and into my brain waves as I burn the midnight oil writing this for you. I truly hope it is helpful.

    I've saved up enough money to live like a monk for a year with little to no social activity. The plan, to learn the basics of web development, win a hackathon, and have someone pay me to hack. I spent almost three months learning to code in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. In the beginning things were so simple. I soon hit a wall, then another, then a chain linked fence surrounded by barbed wire. I realized that I was stepping into a black void of infinite information. I built a couple JS canvas games and some decent looking websites. But I wanted more, and spending 12 hours a day debugging my awful code on my days off wasn't cutting it. So I began my reconnaissance...

    After 2 months of buying programmers coffee, going to meetups, reading blogs, tweeting graduates, and meeting graduates, I felt like I was running for Mayor. Nevertheless, my extensive research brought me to Dev Bootcamp. If you are reading this and considering applying to some version of a Hacker-school, I would strongly encourage you do your own investigation. Skepticism and curiosity are basically fundamentals in this line of work so be diligent. In order to be accepted in the program you have a Skype interview which doubles as a very short test. The test is not

  <h2>The Test</h2>
  <p>
    First, relax. The test is actually about how well you can relax.
    Study exactly what they tell you to study and you will pass.
    There's a logic question.
    There are a few basic coding questions.
    Study exactly what they tell you to study and you will pass.
