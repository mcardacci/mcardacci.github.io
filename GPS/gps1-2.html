      <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
      <p>
        Pair programming is working on software/coding as a two man/woman team. In pair programming there are two roles, the driver, and the navigator. Sometimes there's a senior developer and a junior developer, and at sometimes both developers are equal in experience.
      </p>

    <div id="pp_impo">
      <h3>Why is pair programming important?</h3>
      <p>
        Pair programming is important because it gives us two sets of eyes on the code.  Both developers can benefit from each other's knowledge as well.  This dynamic is especially important when a junior developer works with a senior developer.

    <div id="dr_nav">
      <h3>Comparing Driving and Navigating</h3>
      <p>
        The driver writes the code and the navigator directs the driver what to type and where to go.  Oftentimes, the navigator and driver switch roles.  Understanding both roles is equally important as a developer.

    <!--REFLECTION:
    It was great working with Piara and getting help from Kelsey. By the end of the challenge we both had a better understanding of how to move around elements in HTML and CSS. I think it was easier because we were workign together and had our combined knowledge. I'm definitely feeling more comfortable pairing now that I've done it for the past couple weeks. I have another pairing session in 20 minutes! I think we both understood the Learning Competencies, but we will definitely benefit from more practice over the next few weeks.
