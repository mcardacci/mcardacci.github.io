        <h1>Mind Meld</h1>
          <img src="../IMG/spock.png">
          <p>
            We are now slipping into the fourth week at dev bootcamp and looking back on the material we've learned thus far, I'm beginning to become more aware of my learning style. Admittedly, before I had learned about the Gregorc Thinking style test I dismissed personality tests as rubbish. But working through the curriculum has made me question my beliefs. What is the most effective way for ME to learn?
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent around three months learning to program before I'd even considered Dev Bootcamp. Brute force is what I expected would turn me into a programming wiz. I now realize I was wrong, well, partly. You see strength can't come without exercise and the mind is a muscle that quietly seeks stimulation. Overworking any muscle can cause damage which can happen when an individual is expending brain power and not properly retaining information. Exhibit 'A': Myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Gregorc test reflects how the mind registers information. It categorizes thinking styles by exploring whether or not we grasp data through concrete senses (the here and now), or the abstract (our intuition). Even further, how we collate the data, sequentially (step by logical step), or through random bits (skipping around).
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been labeled as a 'Concrete Random'. There was little difference in score between the first and second time I took the test. As it turns out, concrete random thinkers are a great match for code-craft. We're tinkerers, and the code is our laboratory. We like struggling alone because we're fiercely independent. Due to our tendency to experiment, we like to play by our own rules and can get bored with a required curriculum.
          </p>
           <p>
            Every personality has layers, our tendency to learn a certain way may bring both the positive and/or the negative aspects into the fold. Pinpointing the moment when my 'Concrete Randomness' has trouble choosing only one answer, I can benefit from this realization by asking a classmate for a second opinion or even simply trusting myself. I would like to become more collaborative with my work as I know I've come to understand that there is so much to be learned from other programmers.
          </p>
           <p>
            The growth mindset explains through scientific study that human attributes are not static. They are malleable and can change over time. It's certainly possible to outgrow negative traits. But, it would be foolish of me pretend as if I don't fear being vulnerable. With every line of code I write, my confidence grows both in the language and in myself. Each keystroke is a step in the right direction.
