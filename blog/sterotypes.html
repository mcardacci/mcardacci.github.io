        <h1>Stereotypes</h1>
          <p>
            Social Identity is described by Claude M. Steele as the sense of who we are. It comes from our group memberships and the social categories in which we belong. Examples include age, sex, race, social class, ethnicity etc. He coins a term, Stereotype Threat, in which he claims that if an individual is being negatively stereotyped, they will be unable to perform to the best of their abilities. Identity is situational. The identities that mean so much in one situation may not mean anything to us in another situation.

          In my life I have done a small bit of traveling. Having been raised part in Europe and part in the American south, I have an understanding of the pressures that Steele unearths in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">speech</a> Columbia. While attending an international school in France, I don't recall the slightest mention of race or ethnicity. My classmates were from all over the world. Perhaps it could be chalked up to our youth but my best friends from that time really had no identity me. Let me clarify, I knew where my friends were from and I understood some of their cultural intricacies. But none of that mattered because the social-identity hierarchy didn't really exist there. Race and ethnicity didn't even come into the equation until I moved back to the United States.

            If people were to come to every new situation with an open mind, our quality of life would be much better. I am not by any means saying that understanding stereotypes will stop race riots. But I do know that judgments are very subtle hang-ups. They creep into your thoughts without any conscious effort and can affect the way you think and act. If we could let go of these fears, perhaps one day we would look back at our progress and amaze ourselves.
