        <h1>Big O and Other Algorithm Notation</h1>
          <p>
            An algorithm in computer science is a set of steps for a computer program to accomplish a task. Algorithms put the 'Science' in Computer 'Science'. Across all sciences, efficient algorithms are needed to analyze gigantic data sets or select the right choice intelligently.
          </p>
          <img src="../IMG/data_tree.png">
         <p>
          There are many different types of algorithms but not all algorithms work well in every situation. The pricipal criterion for a good algorithm are:<br>
          1) It must be solve the problem<br>
          2) AND it must do so efficiently
        </p>
          <p>
            Now that we know what algorithms are supposed to do, it's important to understand why most of them <i>can't</i> do their job. The primary purpose for an algorithm is to solve a problem. Well, it turns out most algorithms can't be solved <i>correctly</i>, why? It can take a really, really, really long time. Example:
          </p>
          <p>
            Lets say we wanted to write a program that finds out the most efficient route for you to meet all your friends in NYC. The route starts and ends at your house. <br>
            -You have 20 friends<br>
            -They are all stationary<br>
            <br>
            Calculation:<br>
            19! (factorial of 19)  = 121,645,100,408,832,000
          </p>
          <p>
            It could take a week or more to run this. Instead, most programmers would settle with writing a program that's "ok", but solves the problem in seconds. In most cases "ok" is good enough.
          </p>
          <h2>How Efficiency is Measured</h2>
          <p>
            The obvious metric would be to time how long the code takes to run from start to finish. Unfortunately that metric is corrupted because it only describes the run-speed on that particular input, programming language and computer-hardware.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter <b>Asymptotic Analysis</b>! It is a system of notation that computer scientists use to describe how long an algorithm will take to solve a problem, independent of hardware and programming language. That way we can come to a conclusion that there are some algorithms that are better than others.
          </p>
          <h2>Big O Notation</h2>
          <p>
            Big 'O' is the representation of how fast a program's runtime grows asymptotically. It measures the runtime of your program as the size of your inputs grows towards infinity. e.g. How does it sort an array of size 10 versus size 100,000?
          </p>
          <h2>O(n)</h2>
          <p>
            Let's say we wanted to count the number of characters in a string in the most basic way. Iterate over the string, letter by letter adding 1 to a counter variable.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              <span style="color:Lime;">var</span> <span style="color:orange">=</span> "mouse";

              <span style="color:orange">for</span>(<span style="color:Lime">var</span> count <span style="color:orange">=</span> <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue;">1</span>; count <span style="color:orange"><=</span> mouse.<span style="color:orange">length</span>; count<span style="color:orange">++</span>) {
                <span style="color:DodgerBlue;">console.log</span>(count);
              }
              <span style="color:grey;">//1, 2, 3, 4, 5</span>
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This algorithm runs in <b>Linear Time</b> with respect to the number of characters in the string, 'n' because (n= 5). It is said to have O(n) notation because the time used to traverse the entire string is proportional to the number of characters. Each character takes the same amount of time to look at and the run time increases linearly with the input length.
          </p>
          <h2>O(1)</h2>
          <p>
            Perhaps you are creating huge strings and want a faster method of retrieving the value. You decide store the value in an array. Now, you can call '.push()' or '.pop()' to add or retrieve a value inside the array. 'push' and 'pop' are said to take asymptotically constant time. Why?
          </p>
          <p>
            Think back to what Big O measures. How does your program's runtime change as your input approaches infinity? In this case it wouldn't matter if your string was 2 characters or 2000 characters, 'push' or 'pop' would accomplish the desired task at the same speed. That's why this example would be considered to be running in constant time.
          </p>
          <h2>O(log n)</h2>
          <p>
            Lets say you were searching for a particular number inside an array of sorted numbers. For example:
          </p>
          <p>
            The algorithm is searching for number 3 in this array.
            [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] <br> <br>

            -The algorithm starts at the halfway point, in this case 4 and asks, "Is the element I want greater, less than, or equal to this?" <br> <br>
            -It is less than so all the numbers that are greater than 4 are cut out and we're left with:
            [1, 2, 3] <br> <br>

            -The algorithm starts at the halfway point again and does the same with 2. We are left with 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            This algorithm is known as the "binary search" algorithm and cuts the size of the array in half with each operation. An array of size 8 will have at most, 3 operations. An array with size 16 will have at most, 4 operations. That means doubling the size of the array will only increase the run time by one chunk of code. It's said to run in logarithmic time. (log2 8) = 4 because 2x2x2 = 8
          </p>
