        <h1>GitHub and Version Control</h1>
          <p>
            Storing your code on GitHub means its open for all to see. This can be frightening for those of us accustomed to capitalist society where drinking water costs as much as a can of Coke. For me, surfing GitHub is like going through a deeply religous experience. It's incredible having access to repositories that have been reviewed by experts in the field. That said, I do believe that there are pros and cons to open source code. On one hand, putting more eyes on a piece of work (theoretically) ensures the highest quality product. But on the other hand, the blood, sweat, and tears put into this work is not being paid for. As to who is right, personally the jury is still. I have not yet toiled over code I feel should be proprietary. But lets not make this a discussion on FOSS. Back to Git.
          </p>
          <p>
            Git helps developers track their code by logging all the changes made to a given file. The software, if manipulated properly, ensures the user gets prompted before making any vital change to the code. Even if a mistake is made to the final project, it is still possible for the user to go back to a working version while weeding out the bugs. Git is also the software that is used by the popular open-source code-sharing web application, GitHub. Phew! That was a mouthful.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way I can describe Version control is simply a method of keeping track of the changes you make to a file. A version control system remembers all the changes and exactly when you make them. If part of a file is deleted or a new piece is merged later, the user can go back into our version control system and check to see if the changes made were necessary.
