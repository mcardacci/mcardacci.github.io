        <h1>Ruby Class and Inheritance</h1>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Before I started programming, I viewed my life as a series of connected events that occurred one after the other in time. Inside the universe of a program however, there exists a model of the real world. In an object-oriented programming language, objects communicate with one another. These objects are very similar to the way people, places and things communicate on planet earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Ruby, the 'Class' container organizes objects and methods. Methods are the mode of communication objects use to talk to one another.  Inside these methods are properties called instance variables. Instance variables get passed down like a human mother passes genes to her children. They are distinguished by the '@' symbol at the beginning of their label.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lets create a simple class structure built on alien life forms.
          </p>
          <pre>
              class Alien
                  def initialize
                  end

                  def feed
                  end
              end
          </pre>
          <p>
            This is a basic arbitrary example meant to explain how objects mimic Alien life. 'Alien' in the example above, is the class from which all alien life is instantiated. We want to program Aliens to do two things; make babies, and eat. In order to give an alien life form properties when it's instantiated (created), we need to give it's initialize method properties and instance variables.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              class Alien
                def initialize(name, age)
                    @name = name
                    @age = age
                    @eye_color = "jaundice"
                    @planet = "kukundu"
                    @skin = "scales"
                  end
                def feed
                    puts "consumes matter"
                  end
              end

              child_alien = Alien.new("Frank", 12)
              => @name="Frank", @age=12, @eye_color="jaundice", @planet="kukundu", @skin="scales">

              child_alien.feed
              => "consumes matter"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Now when a new Alien, (child_alien) gets instantiated he is born with properties. It's name and age you have the ability to change. But this is pretty mundane so lets add to its structure a bit. In the following example, we're going to add a lot more functionality, including a parent class called AlienEnvironment that evaluates a temperature_convert method. Let's take a look.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              class AlienEnvironment
                def temperature_convert
                  rand(70) * Math::PI
                end
              end

              class Alien < AlienEnvironment
                @@life_form_ids = []
                def initialize(name, age)
                  @name = name
                  @age = age
                  @eye_color = "jaundice"
                  @planet = "kukundu"
                  @skin = "scales"
                  @@life_form_ids << @name
                end

                def check_the_weather
                  case temperature_convert
                  when 100..1000
                    p "Your bones will fry."
                  when 40..99
                    p "It's safe to go out."
                  else
                    p "It's way too cold to support life."
                  end
                end
                def self.alien_ids()
                  p "The total list of alien ids: #{@@life_form_ids}"
                end
                def feed
                  puts "consumes matter"
                end
              end

              child_alien = Alien.new("Fredrick", 12)
              child_alien.check_the_weather #evaluates to one of the case statements
              =>"Your bones will Fry"

              wacky_alien = Alien.new("tom", 25)
              Alien.alien_ids()
              =>The total list of alien ids: [/"Fredrick"/, /"tom"/]
            </code>
          </pre>
        <h1>Explanation</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              &#8674; From top to bottom we have the AlienEnvironment class that prints out the current temperature on planet kukundu.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&#8674;
              The '<' symbol represents the Alien class inheriting all, (in this case 1) of its instance methods AlienEnvironment.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&#8674;
              Now we can call temperature_convert from an instance of the Alien class.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&#8674;
              You'll notice the presence of a '@@'. This signifies a class method. We can only access these types of methods through the class themselves, not their instances.
            </li>
            <br>
              <ul>
                <li>&#8674;
                  Whenever an Alien gets instantiated now, it's name gets put into an array. This way we    can keep track of the different aliens on our planet.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
            <li>&#8674;
              The check_the_weather method evaluates the number given from the temperature_convert method in AlienEnvironment and prints a string if the number meets one of those conditions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>&#8674;
              self.alien_ids() provides us a way of reading the class method list '@@alien_ids()'
            </li>
          </ul>
        <h1>Importance of Keeping Classes Single Responsibility</h1>
        <p>
          I thought I would mention this book I'm currently reading through, <i>Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</i> from Sandy Metz, an excellent book on program design. She describes the behaviors of classes and methods in the architecture of an application. When classes aren't intricately tangled, they are easy to reuse. This means that you can select/use any method from a given class without having to manipulate or duplicate it's code. Keeping classes simple and controlling their entablements makes code that's not only easier for other programmers to read, but also easier to add on to.

          That's all for now, thanks for reading!
