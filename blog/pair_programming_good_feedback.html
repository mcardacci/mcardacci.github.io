        <h1>Pair Programming & Good Feedback</h1>
          <p>
            Pair programming is an intimate connection. Like getting into a heated debate with a friend or significant other, the ego is tested. That's not to say that the experience is negative. It's more of a snapshot of two minds in their current mental state. The code is a reflection of this state and the time spent together. Programming is really important to me and it's not always easy to share something that you love. When I pair, I do so reluctantly. But after it's over, I've learned so much about myself that I forget why I was so hesitant in the first place.

          </p>
          <p>
            Establishing some sort of rapport before coding, i've found is a critical  step in the pair programming process. It leads me to believe that if there was a solid foundation built beforehand that the code would be exponentially better. That said, pairing may produce stronger code more quickly, but it takes about twice the energy. For me it's draining and I usually take a long break afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giving feedback relies heavily on honesty. But how much is too much? When giving feedback I try to be as positive as I am critical. That way people aren't bombarded by what may appear as negativity. At DBC we have to write feedback to our pairing partner after the session ends. I find it difficult to write feedback. Especially to someone who is struggling with the same problems as me. Sometimes I even feel like I'm giving feedback to myself. I do my best to be actionable, specific and kind. The feedback I receive has been pretty inspiring. It pushes me to make my code cleaner, more readable and better designed.
