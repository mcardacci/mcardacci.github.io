        <h1>Phase 0 Week 1</h1>
          <p>
            Ok I've got my mug of coffee and 'Music For Airports' playing in the background. Let's do this.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my past I had experience in HTML5 and CSS3 and now I feel sufficiently brushed up. We had to make our own website from scratch about ourselves. It's refreshing being overloaded with all this information. Up until this week, most of my focus had been on JavaScript but already DBC has made my mind implode. I like to organize things in my free time and Git is exactly the tool that I've been looking for. In a mere couple days you learn this:
          </p>

          <p>
            Welcome to Git, a version control system that allows you to track the history of all the changes you've made to your program files. People and companies alike use Git for just about any type of file. Be it an old family recipe or a web application it's uses can vary widely.
          </p>
          <p>
            But back to DBC, their approach to learning is awesome. I enjoy challenging myself and the curriculum throws you in the deep end with weights tied around your feet. When you're sinking, your classmates are there to keep you from drowning. They literally feed you a ton of new information every week. I can tell this is going to be a dynamic experience. I can feel all the synapses firing, my brain is starting to morph. I'm signing off. Until next time.
