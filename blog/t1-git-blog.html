      As a straight-up-n00b (aka newb) I will explain Git. Version control. A very positive form of control indeed. This is Git. Some may think of Time Machine on Mac. Time Machine isn't exactly version control as <a href="http://pragmatos.net/2011/09/01/time-machine-is-not-version-control/">this post</a> by Jonathan Lundell clearly points out, but it does have some similarities. Time Machine basically keeps a backup of your entire hard-drive at 1 hour intervals. So if you were to do something unforgivable to your computer, you could go back 'in time' and reverse those changes. However, it will reverse your entire system, which is not the same as version control in Git. Also, over time those backups are removed and only daily backups are saved, and then only monthly backups. Git, as a true version control system, will store all versions of a file that you commit. Each 'commit' can be investigated and reversed if necessary. And all changes can happen parallel to your main files. This feature is known as branches and will be discussed in the next paragraph.

        So how does Git track changes? Well it's up to you as the Git operator. After initializing a directory with Git. You must first save your changes as you would normally. Then you must stage those changed files to be commited. Then you must commit those changes with a description on what changed. This is the process for storing each 'version' of a file. If you'd like to go crazy on some files in a parallel universe you could use branches. Branches will let you work on the same files and save and commit them to a completely seperate branch. You can add new files, delete files, etc. But one day, when those files are looking better to you than the original files, you will want to add those changes to your originals. This will lead you to merge those files. Git does this effortlessly. If any conflicts arrise they are also easy to fix.

        This is when the charming GitHub steps on the scene. Git and GitHub can talk frequently and have very good communication. GitHub excels when collaborating with multiple developers on one project, and displaying all of the changes that each contributor has made. One advantage to using GitHub to store code, is that all of your code will be backed up online as well as locally. This is great becuase you can access this code anywhere from any computer, and you can share the projects you are proud of. GitHub is the location of many open source projects, and really makes the whole Git experience a social one. Git and GitHub live happily ever after. The End.
