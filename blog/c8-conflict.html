              Conflicts happen on larger and smaller scales everyday in a persons life. I've had a few of my own. But for some reason, I find it hard to come up with one at this moment. On most occasions I don't feel very connected to the conflicts in a personal way. I try and take a step back, and often find it hard to get upset. It happens from time to time, but usually because of major life changing events. I definitely feel empathy for people I know or care about if they are going through something tough, but to personally identify with the things that cause them stress isn't always easy. I think one of the things that I do show a level of frustration about once embedded in a conflict is when I feel like my response or initial idea is being misunderstood. I sometimes assume the misunderstanding is intentional and it leads me to a place where I lose interest in the conflict entirely. In those cases I feel like I'm being very clear about where I stand, but of course, that may not always be reality. In some situations I will apply my attitude to others, and therefore expect them to be able to walk away from a heated battle as if it happened in a parallel universe separate from our life before the conflict. Unless, of course what was discussed directly relates to our situation or is of a timely importance. That's a different discussion. Sometimes I feel like I'm one of those pilots who only seconds before crashing yell "Oh shit!", but until that last second they are calm trying to figure out a way out of the situation that benefits everyone involved; Even when it seems impossible. This outlook at a personal level can be an unpleasant trait, as I've learned, because other people don't recognize your emotions, as they differ greatly in outward expression from what's seen as normal. I don't feel that there's a difference in true emotional depth, but I feel like the difference lies in the spontaneity of actions and reactions. In those moments in life when I have reacted hastily, I've very often felt horrible after that I wasn't genuinely represented by my actions. I've learned from those situations. Conflict can't always be avoided, but I usually engage it in a way that I'd hope leads to a nice resolve. That doesn't mean both parties agree. They just agree that agreeing isn't possible in every instance. (I tried to avoid the classic line).
