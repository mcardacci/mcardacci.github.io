            <h3 class="subhead">What is Pair Programming?</h3>
            <p>It's a collaborative effort between two programmers to create a solution to a complex problem. It is useful because it provides answers to the solution from two different sources. It eases the workload on each individual programmer. Allowing them to complete the the problem faster than they would have if they had done it alone. It helps them share ideas on how to code more efficiently.</p>
            <h3 class="subhead">Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h3>
            <p>As a programmer you're more likely to work in teams as opposed to the stereotype of the lone-worker. The purpose of DBC is to not only teach you to program but how to work in a development team. The faster method of writing software is as part of a team. It is an industry standard.</p>
            <h3 class="subhead">Compare Driver and Navigator:</h3>
            <p>The navigator acts as a guide. The driver is the one working on the keyboard, physically coding. But the two positions are not mutually exclusive. The driver is free to offer their input, they don't <i>JUST</i> take orders from the navigator. The roles may switch dependant on the needs of the program or the environment.</p>
            <p>An example of when driver and navigator should switch positions: <br>
            I once paired while working on a series of challenges. I was the navigator, guiding my pair... into a brick wall. After a period of frustration, we decided to switch positions. The new navigator led us to the promised land of completion. From this experience, I learned to be a more efficient programmer. This is just one example of how the roles can be flexible within the framework of Pair Programming. Also how pairing can be beneficial to one or both of the programmers.</p>
