              I think most people feel that the things they value in life are noble. That the qualities of who the are when they are at their best are good qualities, and obviously using the real world as an example it's impossible for that to be universally true. However, some people understand the difference between their values that are selfish and those that are selfless. We all have a mixture of both.

              I have always valued creativity and I'm constantly excited by the ideas and creations of others. I try to participate in creative endeavors as much as I can. I also value credibility immensely. That may be one quality that I look for in almost everyone I meet, and it's something I hope others find in me. To lose credibility has got to be one of the worst feelings in the universe. To achieve credibility, I think you also have to value fairness, and at least understand when a situation isn't fair for all parties involved. To understand what's fair, a certain level of introspection is required. Introspection can be hard to avoid for some people, and may be easily evaded by others. If one's attempt at introspection is a truthful adventure, it can be the arch nemesis of self-esteem, but can also, possibly, lead to a solid mental foundation and courage. Without introspection, it can be hard to feel compassion for others. And without introspection,  judgment on others can easily be turned in the opposite direction.

              I value privacy, but I don't believe it's entirely possible at the moment. I believe that privacy, or at the very least the transparency of the lack-there-of, is something that should be fought for aggressively. Finally, I recognize the quality of one's words and ideas as having a very lasting impression universally. I think we all strive for quality when we are excited by what we are doing. Searching for and producing quality results can lead to the growth and wisdom of an individual. However, red warning flags start flying high when someone starts quoting their degree or achievements as an indication of their wisdom. Wisdom is earned by experience, and can be isolated to so many different aspects of life. Even someone with honest accomplishments and abilities cheapens themselves and opens up the probability to be scrutinized and judged to a much greater length, and there's certainly gonna be something that can be dug up that makes you human again.
