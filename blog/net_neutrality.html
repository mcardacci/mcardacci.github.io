            Just a forewarning, this is an immensely complex subject that at this very moment still unfolding. This blog is about informing the reader so that an independent decision can be made as to whether the current legislation on net neutrality actually makes the internet neutral.
         </p>
         <p>
            Lets start by describing what net neutrality is and what it isn't. Net neutrality is first and foremost a principle. It's an idea that ISP's, (internet service providers) should allow all access to internet content without favoring or blocking products or websites. If ISP's became the gatekeepers of this type of control, users would encounter a 'two-tiered' internet. One tier would be designated the 'fast-lane' where privileged users would experience incredibly fast loading speeds. The 'second-tier', described as the 'slow-lane' is everyone else. To put things in perspective, let's say your service provider is giving campaign funds to the next GOP presidential candidate. ISP's now reserve the right to slow any left-leaning news source to a halt if they so choose. The possibilities for abuse of this power are limitless.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/News_Releases/2002/nrcb0201.html">In 2002 there was decision made to classify 'cable modem service', (the internet) as an 'information service'.</a> This means that the internet is regulated under the same body of laws as a telephone service. They are two completely different technologies. It would be like saying that all food from this point on, has to be eaten with a spoon. Eating noodles will get very messy. This was starting point to the legal misrepresentation of the internet by an older generation of politicians that didn't, and still don't know what the internet is.

            The way political governance has worked since the establishment of America requires a part businessman - part politician to be in charge of important decision making proceedings. Net neutrality is no exception. The man in charge of the future of the internet is Tom Wheeler - current FCC chairman and former cable company lobbyist. Considering Wheeler's past work with big ISP's, an outcome in the favor of tech companies and internet activists seemed unlikely. But something unexpected happened.

            Amidst the proceedings regarding legislation of a section of document named Title II, there was outrage. The biggest tech companies, (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter), in conjunction with internet activists, politicians, protesters and President Obama himself called for the FCC to reclassify ISP's as Title II 'common carriers'. What is Title II? It's part of an ugly piece of legislation that's 300 pages of fine print. It clearly details under the second subsection that 'common carriers' can't “make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services.” Which to me sounds like there is still room to bend the rules. If unreasonable discrimination exists, does that mean reasonable discrimination exists as well? I digress, two days ago on 2/26/15, the FCC voted to enforce the above net neutrality rules.

            Skepticism is a positive notion. The topic is confusing. The truth is, the success or failure of Net Neutrality remains to be seen. The legislation will go through several hearings and edits before it even begins its physical formation. The final product is paramount but as of right now, no one is sure what that will look like. <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/">Stay informed</a>. Thanks for tuning in.
