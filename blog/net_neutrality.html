        <h1>Net Neutrality, the Story So Far.</h1>
          <p>
            Just a forewarning, this is an immensely complex subject that at this very moment still unfolding. This blog is about informing the reader so that an independent decision can be made as to whether the current legislation on net neutrality actually makes the internet neutral. Lets start by describing what net neutrality is and what it isn't. Net neutrality is first and foremost a principle. An idea that ISP's, (internet service providers) should allow all access to internet content without favoring or blocking products or websites. Simply put, ISP's cannot choose what you are allowed to interact with on the net. It is NOT going to stop websites from prioritizing customers based on revenue. Websites are NOT in control of what content you are able view and how fast your internet speed is. That is the job of the ISP which is why this debate is so heated.

            In 2002 there was decision made to classify 'cable modem service' as 'information service'. It was the starting point to the legal misrepresentation of the internet by an older generation politicians that didn't, and still don't know what the internet is.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way political governance has worked since the establishment of America requires a part businessman - part politician to be in charge of important decision making proceedings. Net neutrality is no exception. The man in charge of the future of the internet is Tom Wheeler - current FCC chairman and former cable company lobbyist. Considering Wheeler's past work with big ISP's, an outcome in the favor of tech companies and internet activists seemed unlikely. But something unexpected happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was outrage. The biggest tech companies, (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter), in conjunction with internet activists, politicians, protesters and President Obama himself called for the FCC to reclassify ISP's as Title II 'common carriers'. What is Title II? It's part of an ugly piece of legislation that's 300 pages of fine print. It clearly details under the second subsection that 'common carriers' can't “make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services.” It smacks of a 60's civil rights law. Two days ago, 2/26/15, the FCC voted to enforce the above net neutrality rules.

            Skepticism is a positive notion. The topic is confusing, so much so that opponents are drawing comparisons to Marxism. Which sounds like someone's been spending too many hours flipping between FOX News and the PGA tournament. The truth is, the success or failure of Net Neutrality remains to be seen. The legislation will go through several hearings and edits before it even begins its physical formation. Now we play the waiting game..
