        <h1>Before DBC</h1>
          <p>
            I've saved up enough money to live like a monk for a year with little to no social activity. The plan; to learn the basics of web development, win a hackathon, and have someone pay me to write clean code. I spent almost three months learning to code in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. In the beginning things were so simple. But I soon hit a wall, then another, then a chain linked fence surrounded by a bottomless black pit. I realized that I was stepping into a dark void of infinite information. I built a couple JS canvas games and some decent looking websites. But I wanted more, and spending 12 hours a day debugging my code on my days off wasn't cutting it. So I began my reconnaissance...

            After 2 months of buying programmers coffee, going to meetups, reading blogs, tweeting graduates, and meeting graduates, I felt like I was running for Mayor. My extensive research brought me to Dev Bootcamp.

            In order to be accepted in the program you have a Skype interview. The interview is meant to see if you'd be a good fit into the culture of the program. They also give you a logic problem to analyze your thinking process. These blogs were really helpful to me: <a href="https://dukegreene.wordpress.com/2014/04/14/follow-up-the-scoop-on-dev-bootcamp/">Duke Greene</a> and <a href="http://jayrob.in/dev-bootcamp-phase-1-week-2-day-6/">jayrobin</a>.
          </p>

            If it's your first Skype interview, it's perfectly legitimate to feel nervous. But the test was nothing compared to <a href="Phase_0_week_1.html">Phase 0 Week 1</a>
