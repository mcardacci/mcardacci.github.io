              Classes in Ruby help us organize objects similar to how we would think about objects in the 'real world'. Every object in Ruby happens to be an instance of some class. It could be a String object (part of the String class), Fixnum object (Fixnum class), and many others. Even more compelling, is the possibility of creating your own classes. One such class you could create would be an Album class (as in music album). So to do that all you have to do is write the following:
            </p>
<pre>
<code>
  class Album

  end
</code>
</pre>
            <p>
              This will create a new class called Album. Now you can start building different methods and organizing all of the Album objects and their data in your program. It makes sense to contain certain methods into a specific class since objects can be very different from one another. The information to describe each object could have different parameters and capabilities. In the form of arguments, we can start adding some specific questions that will require answers whenever initializing a new Album object:
            </p>
<pre>
<code>
  class Album

    def initialize(artist, title, release_date, number_of_songs, format)
      @artist = artist
      @album_title = title
      @release_date = release_date
      @number_of_songs = number_of_songs
      @format = format
    end

  end

  sinatra = Album.new("Frank Sinatra", "The Voice of Frank Sinatra", "March 4 1946", 8, "Vinyl")

  => #< Album:0x007ff59c167d00 @artist="Frank Sinatra", @album_title="The Voice of Frank Sinatra", @release_date="March 4 1946", @number_of_songs=8, @format="Vinyl">
</code>
</pre>
            <p>
              We have added to our Album class some of the information we would like to get every time we initialize a new album. Right now this information is required or we would receive an ArgumentError. That can be changed, but in this case it's understandable. Then we create a new instance of Album with the data from Frank Sinatra's first studio album on Columbia Records in 1946. OMG, I am writing this post on March 4th exactly 69 years after the release. With this class we can basically create any album by any artist we would like and store this information within on instance of Album. Cool.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data we gave this object is great, but the power of the class is certainly not being utilized to the fullest. At this point we could start adding some useful methods to the Album class to start really making these useless strings and integers work hard:
            </p>
<pre>
<code>
  class Album

    def initialize(artist, title, release_date, number_of_songs, format)
      @artist = artist
      @album_title = title
      @release_date = release_date
      @number_of_songs = number_of_songs
      @format = format
    end

    def opinion_on_format
      case @format
      when "Vinyl"
        "Good choice, very classic, and honestly anything sounds good on Vinyl."
      when "Cassette"
        "aaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahah!!!!!"
      when "CD"
        "CD's are the way to go. I couldn't be happier with this decision."
      when "MP3"
        "Yeah this is soo the right choice. CD's are depressing."
      when "Digital Stream"
        "Why own when you can rent?"
      else
        "Ok. Have fun with that."
      end
    end

  end

  p sinatra.opinion_on_format

  => "Good choice, very classic, and honestly, anything sounds good on Vinyl."
</code>
</pre>
            <p>
              Now our class is top notch. Of course, not many people care what Ruby thinks of an albums format, but the possibilities are endless to expand this class. It just feels right to be able to group related methods and data together harmoniously.
            <p>
              One more thing to note about classes. There are some different variables at your disposal. I won't go over them all, but in our example above, we've started using instance variables. These types of variables begin with the @ sign. The data they are assigned belongs to every new instance of the class. Unlike local variables, these can be referenced across different methods within an instance of a class. Without instance variables life would be sad.
