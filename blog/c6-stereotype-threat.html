              My initial reaction to thinking about stereotypes and the stereotype threat that Claude Steele talks about in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvwvvbiwRkg">Claude Steele on Stereotype Threat</a> is that stereotypes themselves never describe the true abilities and values of a person. Whether you are stereotyped by age, race, fashion choices, hair styles, or anything; It means nothing. And I do truly believe that. However, I can't discount the idea that the fear of being stereotyped can have a major affect on one's happiness and work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know that I couldn't compare my own experiences with stereotypes to anyone of a different race or older age, but the psychological harm can be very real when feeling you are out of place or not belonging. We often see the extreme cases of people being stereotyped in the media, and even if you are the most confident person in the world, it can play on your emotions. It's also hard to tell someone to just forget about stereotypes and prove themselves through their creativity, intelligence, or work. As Cluade Steele stated: In some situations you just can't avoid the fact that there's a huge difference between you and the rest of the group. He mentioned meeting up with a student at a startup and running into the CEO of a company who was 26 years old, and everyone else in the room was even younger than that. If surrounded by that situation daily, one could easily start to feel the fear of seeming old. Just as someone stuck in a room full of academics may fear that they won't seem intelligent. At that point, you may start to try and use the biggest words you can think of, or simply give up, and either way you're not being yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              One final point is that you can't control what people ultimately think. It comes from their upbringing, or experiences, or entitlement or lack-there-of; and often all of the above. It's worthwhile to understand that certain stereotypes may linger for a while, and some are stronger than ever, but if each person that truly considers these concepts comes to every situation with an open mind and a blank slate for each person they meet, quality of life would gradually get better. I'm not saying the world will change, with all the different religions and races and cultures, but I think it's a personal journey in which you eventually come to accept the way others think and only try and be the best you can be for yourself and for whatever you choose to do with your time on Earth. This isn't about being more productive at work, or making a ton of money. It's about enjoying your life, and your own fear of stereotype will only get in the way.
