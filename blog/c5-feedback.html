              So far, my experiences pairing in DBC have been great. I've met a mixture of people and even hung out personally with one of my classmates. At first, pairing online didn't excite me at all; mainly because I worried about how the format would not allow for comfortable communication. It is safe to say, it has grown on me. At this point, I feel very relaxed and focused working with other programmers in this way.

              It's rewarding to collaboratively work through certain problems and get to see a completely different approach and thought process occurring in real time. In each case, I learn something new about another person and our assigned task. Whether I'm being shown a new shortcut in Sublime, or how to add an alias in .bash_profile, or I'm helping a fellow classmate with a ruby method; It's always a valuable experience.

              When giving feedback after a pairing session, I usually look at what made the session work, and I usually struggle to find any suggestion that wasn't painfully obvious in the session. I usually trust the other person to understand their weakest areas, as I hope to understand mine. There's a fine line between a helpful recommendation that will truly benefit another person, and insulting their process by saying they need to brush up their understandings in any particular area; That line is different for everyone. And in all honesty, I like to get those suggestions out in the pairing sessions themselves. There are some situations where what seemed obvious in the session may not be obvious at all. Talking to a Guide from the program, I did hear about some nightmarish paring sessions that may qualify for a more direct approach. Though, that's rare in my experience. On a side note, I remember pairing recently with a guy who said that almost all his feedback mentioned that he had a tendency to speak fast. At the beginning of our session, he mentioned that if I noticed him speaking fast to just let him know. I never once observed any abnormally fast talking on his part, so either he was taking the feedback to heart or it's a matter of perspective.

              Overall, I like the process of pairing in DBC because it's a completely new experience that 70+ of us are participating in together. We are all interacting with each other way before we meet in person. This will, hopefully, allow us to skip most of the awkward introductions when we enter the campus in April, and we can move on to the next challenge of learning to program.
