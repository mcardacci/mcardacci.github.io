        <h1>The Hacker Commune</h1>
          <p>
            There are a great many pearls of wisdom shared in Shereef's Fireside Chat. A resounding observation he draws is his comparison of student attitudes. He likens an entitled restaurant patron to that of a student whose only expectation is a job post-graduation. This is a tragedy for they've missed the point of <strong>being</strong> a developer. A student that isn't ready to take charge of their experience is in the wrong place. Bringing us to our next comparison, the cook. The cook isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. The cook lives in the kitchen and his job is to make sure the kitchen runs smoothly. Like a well oiled machine all the components must work in sync. Some of the cooks are more skilled than others, nevertheless they're all working together to create something beautiful. If a tomato gazpacho goes bad they work together to fix it. It is the cook who will ultimately thrive in DBC, and in their career as a developer.
          <p>
            It's easy to be passive and let things happen when you're a consumer. This falacy exists in modern education where we're taught to be quiet and listen. The impression I get is that DBC is not that kind of place. I am both nervous and excited to be part of this culture as I know that I will be pushed to my limit. Through failure comes great wisdom.
