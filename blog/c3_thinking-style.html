              When I was first accepted to Dev Bootcamp, I remember I was in the East Village at 'Blue & Gold' (Shout-out to Chris, Nico, Eurie, & Yarkow. I bombed the spelling-bee on those last two names). Anyway, I received the email and didn't even know I had it in me to be that excited. It was a great moment. A few days later, I saw that there were some pre-requisites to starting the class. One of the requirements was finding out my particular thinking style based on the Anthony F. Gregorc Mind-Styles model. This model breaks up 'mind-styles' into Perceptual Qualities and Ordering Abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3>Perceptual Qualities:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Concrete : You deal with what is 'in the flesh'. Those things that fall within the 5 senses.</li>
                <li>Abstract : You use intuition, imagination, and look beyond the 5 senses to more subtle possibilities, and hidden meanings.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3>Ordering Abilities:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Sequential : You organize information in a linear manner. Can prefer plans instead of improvising.</li>
                <li>Random : You organize information in 'chunks', without a need for order. May prefer to be more impulsive than plotting out a specific plan.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              These are very short explanations of each quality. More can be read <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I ended up taking the test to see which Mind Style I am. I found out I'm an even mixture of Abstract Random & Concrete Random. Reading about the qualities of these types of mind-styles completely made sense to me. I do identify with those traits, the good and the bad.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp is an experience that is mostly managed by personal drive. Time and learning are guided through a really well crafted curriculum, but at the end of the day it's up to your own motivation to get to work on the problems, and read the presented materials. As someone who has qualities of a Concrete Random thinker, who likes to experiment to find answers, and solve problems independently, this is great. Then when you introduce pair-programming, which is required two times, sometimes three times, a week, I believe my Abstract Random qualities start to show. I begin to listen to others, and try to build healthy relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my opinion, most learning experiences are not welcoming to Concrete Random / Abstract Random mind-styles, and I've tried to understand that for years. With the combination of these mind-styles, one may have problems dealing with routines, formal reports, restrictions, limitations, working with authoritative personalities, and criticism (even positive). This is what sets DBC apart. So far, I've felt very comfortable in this learning environment. When you love what you are doing, it's a lot easier for you to be flexible with some of the things that aren't naturally part of your mind-style attributes. Routine can be unavoidable sometimes. I wouldn't say I hate it, but I have a tendency to want to break it up as much as possible. I could go on forever about mind-styles, but if you'd like to take the test yourself, please check out the following link: <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">THE SCARY TEST!!!</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the first things discussed at DBC was the difference between Growth and Fixed mindsets. This is a topic I have thought about a lot. All of us have been surrounded by a mixture of these two mind-sets, but I have never understood the feeling of being stuck at an intellectual level that doesn't grow. I know that when I've learned something important in my life, that experience was a huge moment of growth for my intelligence either socially, or academically, or emotionally, or all of the above. The mind is a constantly expanding. Every day I feel like there is growth. Sometimes small, sometimes large. Anyone that insists static intelligence is real, is not perceiving their own growth. They are also doubting the capabilities of others to grow. That's dark. There's always something I can learn from you, and I think DBC promotes that as a mutual agreement.
