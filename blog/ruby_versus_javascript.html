        <h1>Ruby versus JavaScript</h1>
          <p>
            I should preface this by saying that one language is not better than the other. Both languages have different uses with a small bit of overlap.
          </p>
          <h2>Ruby</h2>
         <p>
          The programming language Ruby was created in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto. The architecture of Ruby was designed for programmer productivity and fun. Matsumoto's philosophy of design focuses on human rather than computer functionality. Due to Ruby's easy-to-read syntax, it is simple for beginner programmers to use and powerful enough for the experienced programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ruby has libraries for building all kinds of applications from GUI bindings to game libraries. Once Ruby is installed properly, the programmer will have full access to the Ruby Gems program which is essentially the App Store for program libraries. You can take these libraries and import them into your own program if you so desire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Ruby is often ridiculed for slow processing speed, it can still take care of typical scripting language applications like text processing and small scripts. For larger programs, it may be best to venture outside the realm of Ruby.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ruby's most successful application is the Ruby on Rails framework. It contains database backends, libraries and a huge amount of support subscripts. Rails makes building a large software system in Ruby possible.
          </p>
          <h2>Javascript</h2>
          <p>
            The language was created by Brendan Eich while working for Netscape in the 90's. Netscape was looking to create an interpreted language that would appeal to beginner programmers. After many transformations and marketing blunders it became the embedded scripting language of the internet. Javascript is mainly used on web pages, though it does have other uses such as PDF documents, server-side web apps, and I believe some Adobe design tools are written in it as well. After a web page is loaded with HTML and CSS, JavaScript converts the static page into a interactive experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past, when a user filled out a form on the web, they had to wait for a new page to load every time they made a request. Now the request can be made exponentially faster without the need for reloading a page. Javascript can check each individual field in real time and tell the user immediately if a mistake has been made.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript also has the power to make animations. These animations can be purely artistic but mostly they're used to draw the user's attention to a portion of the website. You can provide responses in JS embedded in the page when the user makes an action so that the page doesn't have to be reloaded. In JS there are methods to communicate to servers and even servers written in JS.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many programmers who loathe JavaScript. Douglas Crockford, a JS guru, calls javascript "The world's most misunderstood language." There are few iterator methods, issues using big numbers, issues with decimals, and prototypal inheritance. Not to mention that JS won't be seen if the user doesn't have javascript enabled. Every language has it's pros and cons. The bottom line is that every language will teach you something new, something you forgot, or both.
