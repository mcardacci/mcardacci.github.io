       In recent years we've learned a lot about the surveillance conducted by the NSA. This has started to take it's toll on the tech industry. The Brazilian government has said adeus to Microsoft. Germany has stated that no federal contracts will go to companies that share information with the U.S. Government, and China has halted using high-profile U.S. tech companies for any state purchases including Apple, Intel, McAffee, and Cisco.

       There's clearly a lot of pressure in multiple directions that these companies must endure, and I can't imagine how tricky that must be. First, you have a healthy chunk of the U.S. population not happy about the domestic surveillance. Then, you have the U.S. government wanting to continue and maybe add to current surveillance. Lastly, you have foreign governments that no longer trust the companies caught up in this mess. It's hard enough running a business, let alone dealing with all of that. It's impossible to make everyone happy. Now it's going to be harder than ever to reinstate the trust, if it's even possible. In some cases, the NSA has been intercepting routers, servers, and other network devices on their way out of the country. They implant back-door surveillance tools and then repackage these devices with a factory-seal, and continue the shipping process. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/12/glenn-greenwald-nsa-tampers-us-internet-routers-snowden">The Guardian explains more here</a>.

       Some companies are maintaining that any back-door implants are news to them. However, that's hard to prove and hard to believe. We really don't know how much legal pressure comes down on these companies, and what they can and can't say. The ramifications haven't been fully realized at this point, but we shall continue to see the consequences, good and bad, for the foreseeable future. This is a tough area to imagine having a solid solution because most of these vulnerabilities are so complex for the ordinary person that they don't seem real or important, but I know for me every step on my journey with coding and learning about networks show me how surprisingly vulnerable we really are, and I know I've only scratched the surface. If you're interested in this topic, The Guardian has an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden">entire section kept up to date on these leaks made possible by Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald</a>. Technology companies are definitely not going anywhere, but this knew knowledge may play a role in which ones rise to the top.
