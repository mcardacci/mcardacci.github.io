  <h2>My feelings / rant on the topic</h2>

      After watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> I found myself philosophically connecting, again, with the messages at the core of Dev Bootcamp. One message that I identify with is that intelligence is much harder to quantify than most people like to think. Education can cost a lot of money. Education can be a lot of work. However, the school you went to has nothing to do with how intelligent you are. Intelligence comes out of your own experiences and is affected by social, cultural, spiritual, and academic elements. At a basic level, an education can give you a structured way of communicating your thoughts. Education is just one of the aspects of intelligence as a whole. I feel like watching Shereef's video shows that there's a community that feels that way too. I want in on the fun.

      The way this DBC learning environment seems to be setup, so far, has been very refreshing. Self-motivation is promoted, and, still, there is a structure that gives solid direction and clear checkpoints that you can arrive at, and know how you are doing. This works well for my learning style. I enjoy working hard, but feeling encouraged to take breaks adds a lot to the quality of my work. I'm excited to be joining this group of up-and-coming developers. Thanks. Be good to yourselves.

      EDIT: I actaully realized that I never addressed the topic that Shareef talks about with respect to the restaurant vs kitchen analogy. That analogy is amazing. Often it is very hard to get out of the mindset that you are owed something when you are 'making it rain'. That's how society is running currently, but to be compassionate and willing to jump in and help is priceless. But, for everything else...there's mastercard.
